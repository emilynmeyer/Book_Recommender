and are surprised with a new baby brother and a new cousin\"--', \"the fox news host gives an account of the relationship between president theodore roosevelt and booker t. washington.the new york times bestselling author of george washington's secret six and thomas jefferson and the tripoli pirates turns to two other heroes of the nation: theodore roosevelt and booker t. washington. when president theodore roosevelt welcomed the country’s most visible black man, booker t. washington, into his circle of counselors in 1901, the two confronted a shocking and violent wave of racist outrage. in the previous decade, jim crow laws had legalized discrimination in the south, eroding social and economic gains for former slaves. lynching was on the rise, and black americans faced new barriers to voting. slavery had been abolished, but if newly freed citizens were condemned to lives as share croppers, how much improvement would their lives really see? in teddy and booker t., brian kilmeade tells the story of how two wildly different americans faced the challenge of keeping america moving toward the promise of the emancipation proclamation. theodore roosevelt was white, born into incredible wealth and privilege in new york city. booker t. washington was black, born on a plantation without even a last name. but both men embodied the rugged, pioneering spirit of america. kilmeade takes us to san juan hill, where roosevelt led his rough riders to a thrilling victory that set the stage for a legendary presidency, and to a small town in alabama, where washington founded the first university for african americans, paving the way for the civil rights movement. both men abhorred the decadence and moral rot the nation had fallen into, believed that improvement through careful collaboration was possible, and trusted that the american ideals of individual liberty and hard work could propel the neediest toward success, if only those holding them back would step aside. as he did in george washington's secret six, kilmeade has transformed this nearly forgotten slice of history into a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages to find out how these two heroes, through their principles and courage, not only changed each other, but helped lay the groundwork for true equality.\", 'the pulitzer prize-winning biographer details samuel adams’s

bestselling author of killers of the flower moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. with the twists and turns of a thriller grann unearths the deeper meaning of the events on the wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire. on january 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of brazil. inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. they were survivors of his majesty’s ship the wager, a british vessel that had left england in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with spain. while the wager had been chasing a spanish treasure-filled galleon known as “the prize of all the oceans,” it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of patagonia. the men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing 2500 miles of storm-wracked seas. they were greeted as heroes. but then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of chile. this boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. the thirty sailors who landed in brazil were not heroes – they were mutineers. the first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. it became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. as accusations of treachery and murder flew, the admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. the stakes were life-and-death—for whomever the court found guilty could hang. the wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. grann’s recreation of the hidden world on a british warship rivals the work of patrick o’brian, his portrayal of the castaways’ desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as the endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a scott turow thriller. as always with grann’s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.', \"the big cheese learns a lesson

practical, heartfelt guide to the art of truly knowing another person in order to foster deeper connections at home, at work, and throughout our lives—from the author of the road to character and the second mountain as david brooks observes, “there is one skill that lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make them feel seen—to accurately know another person, to let them feel valued, heard, and understood.” and yet we humans don’t do this well. all around us are people who feel invisible, unseen, misunderstood. in how to know a person, brooks sets out to help us do better, posing questions that are essential for all of us: if you want to know a person, what kind of attention should you cast on them? what kind of conversations should you have? what parts of a person’s story should you pay attention to? driven by his trademark sense of curiosity and his determination to grow as a person, brooks draws from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and from the worlds of theater, philosophy, history, and education to present a welcoming, hopeful, integrated approach to human connection. how to know a person helps readers become more understanding and considerate toward others, and to find the joy that comes from being seen. along the way it offers a possible remedy for a society that is riven by fragmentation, hostility, and misperception. the act of seeing another person, brooks argues, is profoundly creative: how can we look somebody in the eye and see something large in them, and in turn, see something larger in ourselves? how to know a person is for anyone searching for connection, and yearning to be understood.', 'the founder of the rock band wilco explores 50 songs that

bestseller • a groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert “one of the most important books you’ll ever read.”—steven d. levitt, new york times bestselling author of freakonomics wouldn’t you like to live longer? and better? in this operating manual for longevity, dr. peter attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health. for all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. dr. attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting. this is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. dr. attia’s aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. in outlive, readers will discover: • why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn’t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack. • that you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging. • why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity “drug”—and how to begin training for the “centenarian decathlon.” • why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern. • why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all. aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. with the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.', \"inez olivera sets sail to investigate the mysterious deaths of her parents in 1884 egypt.after centuries of sleep, the gods are

most visible black man, booker t. washington, into his circle of counselors in 1901, the two confronted a shocking and violent wave of racist outrage. in the previous decade, jim crow laws had legalized discrimination in the south, eroding social and economic gains for former slaves. lynching was on the rise, and black americans faced new barriers to voting. slavery had been abolished, but if newly freed citizens were condemned to lives as share croppers, how much improvement would their lives really see? in teddy and booker t., brian kilmeade tells the story of how two wildly different americans faced the challenge of keeping america moving toward the promise of the emancipation proclamation. theodore roosevelt was white, born into incredible wealth and privilege in new york city. booker t. washington was black, born on a plantation without even a last name. but both men embodied the rugged, pioneering spirit of america. kilmeade takes us to san juan hill, where roosevelt led his rough riders to a thrilling victory that set the stage for a legendary presidency, and to a small town in alabama, where washington founded the first university for african americans, paving the way for the civil rights movement. both men abhorred the decadence and moral rot the nation had fallen into, believed that improvement through careful collaboration was possible, and trusted that the american ideals of individual liberty and hard work could propel the neediest toward success, if only those holding them back would step aside. as he did in george washington's secret six, kilmeade has transformed this nearly forgotten slice of history into a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages to find out how these two heroes, through their principles and courage, not only changed each other, but helped lay the groundwork for true equality.\", 'the 27th book in the dirk pitt series. a murderous cabal targets water treatment facilities around the world.intrepid

based on untapped archival materials and reports.a landmark history of one hundred years of war waged against the palestinians from the foremost us historian of the middle east, told through pivotal events and family history in 1899, yusuf diya al-khalidi, mayor of jerusalem, alarmed by the zionist call to create a jewish national home in palestine, wrote a letter aimed at theodore herzl: the country had an indigenous people who would not easily accept their own displacement. he warned of the perils ahead, ending his note, “in the name of god, let palestine be left alone.” thus rashid khalidi, al-khalidi’s great-great-nephew, begins this sweeping history, the first general account of the conflict told from an explicitly palestinian perspective. drawing on a wealth of untapped archival materials and the reports of generations of family members—mayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalists—the hundred years' war on palestine upends accepted interpretations of the conflict, which tend, at best, to describe a tragic clash between two peoples with claims to the same territory. instead, khalidi traces a hundred years of colonial war on the palestinians, waged first by the zionist movement and then israel, but backed by britain and the united states, the great powers of the age. he highlights the key episodes in this colonial campaign, from the 1917 balfour declaration to the destruction of palestine in 1948, from israel’s 1982 invasion of lebanon to the endless and futile peace process. original, authoritative, and important, the hundred years' war on palestine is not a chronicle of victimization, nor does it whitewash the mistakes of palestinian leaders or deny the emergence of national movements on both sides. in reevaluating the forces arrayed against the palestinians, it offers an illuminating new view of a conflict that continues to this day.\", 'the second book in the maple hills series. two summer camp counselors who previously had a

“bag man” details a campaign to overthrow the u.s. government and install authoritarian rule prior to and during our involvement in world war ii.rachel maddow traces the fight to preserve american democracy back to world war ii, when a handful of committed public servants and brave private citizens thwarted far-right plotters trying to steer our nation toward an alliance with the nazis. “a ripping read—well rendered, fast-paced and delivered with the same punch and assurance that she brings to a broadcast. . . . the parallels to the present day are strong, even startling.”—the new york times inspired by her research for the hit podcast ultra, rachel maddow charts the rise of a wild american strain of authoritarianism that has been alive on the far-right edge of our politics for the better part of a century. before and even after our troops had begun fighting abroad in world war ii, a clandestine network flooded the country with disinformation aimed at sapping the strength of the u.s. war effort and persuading americans that our natural alliance was with the axis, not against it. it was a sophisticated and shockingly well-funded campaign to undermine democratic institutions, promote antisemitism, and destroy citizens’ confidence in their elected leaders, with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the u.s. government and installing authoritarian rule. that effort worked—tongue and groove—alongside an ultra-right paramilitary movement that stockpiled bombs and weapons and trained for mass murder and violent insurrection. at the same time, a handful of extraordinary activists and journalists were tracking the scheme, exposing it even as it was unfolding. in 1941 the u.s. department of justice finally made a frontal attack, identifying the key plotters, finding their backers, and prosecuting dozens in federal court. none of it went as planned. while the scheme has been remembered in history—if at all—as the work of fringe players, in reality it involved a large number of some of the country’s most influential elected officials. their interference in law enforcement efforts against the plot is a dark story of the rule of law bending and then breaking under the weight of political intimidation. that failure of the legal system had consequences. the tentacles of that unslain beast have reached forward into our history for decades. but the heroic efforts of the activists, journalists, prosecutors, and regular citizens who sought to expose the insurrectionists also make for a deeply resonant, deeply relevant tale in our own disquieting times.', 'in
