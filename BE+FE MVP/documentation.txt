Steps I took to build this:
1. Moved the bestsellers_dictionary.py script into this directory
2. Ran bestsellers_dictionary.py to update the list 
2. Changed the retrieval code from a jupyter notebook into a python script
3. Edited the retrieval code to make it return ISBN's 
4. Created a basic interface with HTML + CSS + HTMX for Requests
5. Setup a basic Flask App as the backend 
6. Had flask app serve index.html 
7. Created an endpoint to take in ISBN 10, ISBN 13, or a book title 
8. Wrote a script to use google books API get that book's description
9. Generated a query for the retreival code with the description
10. Used returned ISBN's to call the google books api to get author, title, and thumbnail link
11. Rendered this data on a jinja template and return it to the browser
